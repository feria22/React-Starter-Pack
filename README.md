# React Starter Pack

Welcome to my React Starter Pack with Webpack, Jest, Sass, and Module Styles! This project provides a robust foundation for building React applications with Webpack, includes Jest for testing, Sass for styling, and supports CSS Modules for modular styling. It allows you to quickly start developing modern web applications.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`

## Development
To start the development server, run:

`npm start-dev`

This will start the development server and open your application in your default web browser. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

##Testing with Jest
Jest is configured for testing in this project. You can run the tests using:

`npm test`

You can write your tests in the __tests__/ directory, and Jest will automatically discover and run them.


##Production Build
To build your application for production, run:

`npm run build-prod`

This will create an optimized production build in the dist directory.

## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- **src/**: This is where your application source code goes, including React components, styles, and other assets.
- **public**/: Contains your public assets, like HTML files and images.
- **build**/: The output directory for the production build.
- **__webpack__**/: Webpack configuration for both development and production builds.
- **__jest__**/Folder with Jest configuration
- **__tests__**/ Folder with unit tests
